# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a dedicated Project Lead, Product Owner, and Research Data Manager with a Ph.D. in cancer research. My journey has been driven by a passion for transforming data into meaningful insights, and I have been fortunate to work on projects that align with this goal. <br> 
Currently, as a Metadata Specialist at DataCite, I contribute to strategic planning, promote and refine the DataCite metadata schema, and ensure its seamless integration into broader PID infrastructures. I also perform quality assurance checks and provide training and support to enhance metadata quality. 
<br> Before joining DataCite, I worked at SciLifeLab-DataCentre, where I led the implementation of open-source technical solutions. I also had the pleasure of leading a  team of developers and data stewards in an agile environment. My certification as a product owner from scrum.org has been instrumental in this role.
<br>In my previous position as Unit Head for Research Data Management at the Max Delbrück Centre for Molecular Medicine (MDC), I helped develop strategies, policies, and procedures to support open research.
<br>One of the projects I am proud of is leading the development of the Open Data module for NASAs OpenCore project. It was a unique opportunity to coordinate efforts across the globe.
<br>Co-founding FAIRPoints and serving on the steering committee for the FAIR Digital Objects forum has allowed me to engage with a community that shares my commitment to FAIR data principles.
<br>I also mentor at Open Life Science and actively participate in various communities, promoting Open & FAIR Research practices and advocating for equality, diversity, and inclusion.
<br>If you are interested in discussing FAIR data principles, open science, or data-driven research practices, I would love to connect.'
