- title: Ten simple rules for pushing boundaries of inclusion at academic events.
  publishedIn:
    name:  PLoS Comput Biol.
    date: 1 March 2024
    url: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011797
  paper:
    summary: Inclusion at academic events is facing increased scrutiny as the communities these events serve raise their expectations for who can practically attend. Active efforts in recent years to bring more diversity to academic events have brought progress and created momentum. However, we must reflect on these efforts and determine which underrepresented groups are being disadvantaged. Inclusion at academic events is important to ensure diversity of discourse and opinion, to help build networks, and to avoid academic siloing. All of these contribute to the development of a robust and resilient academic field. We have developed these Ten Simple Rules both to amplify the voices that have been speaking out and to celebrate the progress of many Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity practices that continue to drive the organisation of academic events. The Rules aim to raise awareness as well as provide actionable suggestions and tools to support these initiatives further. This aims to support academic organisations such as the Deep Learning Indaba, Neuromatch Academy, the IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo, Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), Arabs in Neuroscience, FAIRPoints, and OLS (formerly Open Life Science). This article is a call to action for organisers to reevaluate the impact and reach of their inclusive practices.

- title: InterPro in 2017-beyond protein family and domain annotations. 
  publishedIn:
    name:  Nucleic Acids Res.
    date: 4 January 2017
    url: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1107
  paper:
    summary: InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) is a freely available database used to classify protein sequences into families and to predict the presence of important domains and sites. InterProScan is the underlying software that allows both protein and nucleic acid sequences to be searched against InterPro's predictive models, which are provided by its member databases. Here, we report recent developments with InterPro and its associated software, including the addition of two new databases (SFLD and CDD), and the functionality to include residue-level annotation and prediction of intrinsic disorder. These developments enrich the annotations provided by InterPro, increase the overall number of residues annotated and allow more specific functional inferences.

- title:  InterPro in 2019- improving coverage, classification and access to protein sequence annotations 
  publishedIn:
    name:  Nucleic Acids Res.
    date: 8 January 2019
    url: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1100
  paper:
    summary: The InterPro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) classifies protein sequences into families and predicts the presence of functionally important domains and sites. Here, we report recent developments with InterPro (version 70.0) and its associated software, including an 18% growth in the size of the database in terms on new InterPro entries, updates to content, the inclusion of an additional entry type, refined modelling of discontinuous domains, and the development of a new programmatic interface and website. These developments extend and enrich the information provided by InterPro, and provide greater flexibility in terms of data access. We also show that InterPro's sequence coverage has kept pace with the growth of UniProtKB, and discuss how our evaluation of residue coverage may help guide future curation activities.

  publishedIn:
    name:  Science Business
    date: 14 September 2023

  paper:
    summary: The article from Science|Business highlights the hurdles to effective data sharing, despite the push for open science. These challenges include variations across disciplines, legal and ethical concerns, and insufficient incentives. The Research Data Alliance (RDA) is tackling these issues by promoting FAIR data principles, offering guidelines, and supporting researchers with training and infrastructure. The RDA also emphasizes the role of domain ambassadors in fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration and making data sharing more practical and appealing for researchers.

- title: Developing a mapping process framework 
  publishedIn:
    name:  Zenodo
    date: 30 April 2024

  paper:
    summary: FAIR-IMPACT conducts workshops on mapping and crosswalks within the community, aiming to standardise the mapping process by identifying common components and approaches used in community practices. These workshops consist of practical sessions, presentations on initial experiences, and feedback regarding the framework, followed by applying the framework to mapping exercises. Semantic artefacts, such as ontologies and vocabularies, are crucial for data interoperability and implementing FAIR principles. FAIR-IMPACT focuses on making mappings shareable and reusable, elevating them to citizens in the FAIR data world. In previous FAIR-IMPACT workshops, we explored the motivation behind mappings and methodologies for making them FAIR. In this workshop, we aim to formalise a mapping process framework based on community practices and trial its implementation.
